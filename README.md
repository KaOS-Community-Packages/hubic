# hubic
Synchronization service provided by OVH.

Get a hubiC folder on all your computers and sychronise content across them all. Anything you drag and drop into this folder is then stored in hubiC so that you can access it from your tablet, smartphone or via the web application. If you make changes to a file on your computer, it will then be automatically updated across your other devices.
